# pseudo4D-analysis-guide

The published notebooks are a guide for users analyzing pseudo-4D data. The goal is to provide a starting point for scientists planning to do thier own studies.

## About

While the analysis was done in Matlab, [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an excellent format to share equations, computational output, visualizations, and other multimedia resources, along with explanatory text in a single document. Furthermore, it is very convenient to share and read the notebook in Github. As such, all notebooks are set up for [Matlab-Jupyter](https://am111.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jmatlab_install.html)

Open Source Software is not about the code in the first place but the communications and community. People love good documentation and obvious workflows.
