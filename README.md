# pseudo4D-analysis-guide

The published notebooks are a guide for users analyzing pseudo-4D data. The goal is to share the code and methods used for this research. We hope this will provide a useful starting point for scientists planning to do thier own studies.

>We investigate solidification of an Al-Cu alloy as a model system to understand the emergence of patterns (such as lamellar, rod and maze-like) within eutectic colonies. To uncover the morphological transitions in situ and in 3D, we introduce here a new synchrotron-based procedure termed pseudo-4D X-ray imaging. Our method simultaneously maximizes the temporal (200 ms) and spatial resolution (0.69 um<sup>2</sup>/pixel) over that of traditional imaging approaches. The wealth of information obtained from this procedure enables us to visualize the development of a crystallographically ‘locked’ eutectic microstructure in the presence of thermosolutal convection. This data provides direct insight into the mechanism of the lamella-to-rod transition as the eutectic accommodates fluctuations in interfacial composition and growth velocity. We offer evidence to show that this transition is diffusive. It is brought about by impurity-driven forces acting on the solid-solid-liquid trijunction that must overcome the stiffness of the solid-solid interfaces. Our pseudo-4D imaging strategy holds broad appeal to the solidification science community, as it can overcome the space-time trade-off in conventional in situ X-ray microtomography.

## About

While the analysis was done in Matlab, [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an excellent format to share equations, computational output, visualizations, and other multimedia resources, along with explanatory text in a single document. Furthermore, it is very convenient to share and view the notebook in Github. As such, all codes are set up in [Matlab-Jupyter](https://am111.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jmatlab_install.html) in an effort to create a clear and understandable workflow.

The data can be accessed online through XX
